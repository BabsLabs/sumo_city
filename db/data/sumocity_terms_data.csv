Yotsu-zumō,四つ相撲,"There are two main types of wrestling in sumo: oshi-zumō and yotsu-zumō. yotsu-zumō is where both wrestlers grasp the other's belt with both hands, hence the literal translation: four sumo or four hands on the mawashi sumo. there are a few sub-types of yotsu-zumō. migi-yotsu (右四つ) is when one has sashite (差して) on the right (migi), meaning that one has his right hand under his opponent's left arm and grasping his mawashi. hidari-yotsu is the opposite where one's left (hidari) hand is inside the opponent's right arm. a yotsu-zumō fighter will typically prefer left or right and is referred to as migi-yotsu or hidari-yotsu fighter. if one has no preference, they are referred to as namakura-yotsu (鈍ら四つ), where namakura literally translates as lazy or cowardly, suggesting that having no preference is seen in a negative light. there is one other final yotsu grip known as moro-zashi (両差し), literally sashite on both sides, where both hands are inside and is a very strong grip. the only real defense for a moro-zashi grip is the kimedashi (極めだし) technique where the defending wrestler wraps both of his arms over the moro-zashi grip and locks his hands underneath, which squeezes the double inside grip together, weakening it, and allowing one to force the opponent out of the ring. kime-dashi is also known as kannuki (閂, usually written in hiragana as かんぬき), and means to bolt or bar. when two wrestlers who both fight in the yotsu-zumō style oppose each other and favor the same style grip, either migi-yotsu or hidari-yotsu, then they will fit together nicely in what is called ai-yotsu (相四つ), or together yotsu. if however they are of opposite preferences, then it is known as kenka-yotsu (喧嘩四つ), literally fighting yotsu. in this situation, whoever gets his preferred grip is usually the victor."
